#  Contribution Policy
I have created the `arc-py` package, but had very limited time for it. 
It's just good enough to be useful (hopefully), 
but bad enough that people could easily find a way to improve it. Go ahead and create an issue / PR if you have an idea! 

## Including the original dataset

In order to create a distributable version, 
 developer needs to check out original ARC repository. 
Go to the `./arc` directory and clone the original repo with 
`git clone https://github.com/fchollet/ARC`.
